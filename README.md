# Disasters Response Code

This repo contains 4 files:
* a demo of a Machine Learning python code - This is for my personal use before modulazing the code.
* a process_data python script. The input and output are database filepath and a cleaned data set ready to be fed into a ML pipeline
* a train_classifie python script. This script trains the MultipleOutputRegressor model so that it can classify new incoming messages.
* a run.py model which deploys the python script to an online app using a given database.
